+ For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
+ to commit it to your repository.

+ You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
+ or to provide custom queries or build logic.

 ******** NOTE ********
 We have attempted to detect the languages in your repository. Please check
 the `language` matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
 supported CodeQL languages.

   If you wish to specify custom queries, you can do so here or in a config file.
   By default, queries listed here will override any specified in a config file.
   Prefix the list here with "+" to use these queries and those in the config file.

   Autobuild attempts to build any compiled languages  (C/C++, C#, or Java).
   If this step fails, then you should remove it and run the build manually (see below)
