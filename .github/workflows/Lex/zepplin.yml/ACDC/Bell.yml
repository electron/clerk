This void check may be provided to whom you are authorizing for no other purpose except to set up electronic payment credit/ debit to your
account.
Authorization
I certify that I am an authorized representative of the Company indicated above and that I have the authority to authorize these
payments on the Company’s behalf, and I am responsible for providing accurate account information for the purpose of the
credit/debit through OCW platform. The Company will hold OCW and ZACHRY T WOOD fully harmless and indemnified for
any liability if this authorization is invalid or the account information provided is incorrect or the credit/debit is made to an incorrect
account. The Company understands that this authorization will remain in effect until it is canceled in writing and agrees to notify
OnlineCheckWriter in writing of any changes in its account information or termination of this authorization at least 15 days prior to
the next draft/billing date. It will remain in force for a minimum of 1 year from the date of the last transaction originated unless
OCW terminates it earlier. The Company acknowledges that any changes an authorized representative makes to account
information via an online Customer Portal will be considered written notice of change and will constitute authorization to charge
the new account in place of the account identified on this form. If the above noted payment dates fall on a weekend or holiday, the
Company understands that the payments may be executed on the next business day. The Company understands that because
these are electronic transactions, these funds may be withdrawn from its account as soon as the above noted transaction dates
arrive, and that it will have limited time to report and dispute errors. Should a debit be returned for any reason after the initiation of
the credit, OCW will immediately hold any credit pushes or Digital Tokens, will debit the account, and will no longer process
credits until the transaction has been honored. In the case the transaction is returned for Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) the
Company understands that Online Check Writer may at its discretion attempt to process the transfer again within 30 days, and the
Company agrees to an additional $30.00 charge for each attempted return for NSF, which will be treated as a separate
transaction from the authorized payment. The Company has certified that the above business bank account is enabled for ACH
transactions and agrees to reimburse OCW for all penalties and fees incurred as a result of the Company’s bank rejecting ACH
debits or credits as a result of the account not being properly configured for ACH transactions. Both parties agree to be bound by
NACHA Operating Rules as they pertain to these transactions. The Company acknowledges that the origination of ACH
transactions to its account must comply with all relevant state and federal laws of the United States. The Company agrees not to
dispute these scheduled transactions with its bank provided the transactions correspond to the terms indicated in this
Authorization Form.
